							<h1>Posters</h1>
							<p>I created several poster designs as practice work, exploring different styles and compositions. One of the designs was made as a custom graphic for a hoodie print. All projects were done in <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>, focusing on layout, color, and creative concept development. These works represent my first steps into graphic design and print-ready artwork.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic18.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The <b>Adidas</b> poster features a red-themed concept with a bold splash effect and graphic lines in the background. The centerpiece is a pair of red sneakers placed on a brick wall mockup, emphasizing a strong urban feel.</p>
							<p>The <b>Mustang</b> poster presents a red Mustang car in the foreground with a dark background. The composition includes the Ford logo in the corner and a stylized white horse mask behind the text — designed as a sharp silhouette without texture, serving as a strong visual element. The overall mood of the poster is bold and dynamic, matching the character of the Mustang brand.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic19.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This poster was created as a tribute to a friend who tragically passed away in a motorcycle accident. On the left side is the original hoodie design I made in his memory. In the center is a photo of another friend wearing the hoodie in the Alps, Italy. On the right side are mockups of the hoodie made for presentation purposes.
							This project holds a special emotional value, and more than ten copies of the hoodie were made. The audience and friends responded positively, appreciating both the design and its deeper message.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic20.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This poster was designed for Dane Milić, a private basketball coach. The focus was on clear presentation of key information, using color theory to ensure readability and highlight important details. The design follows a clean and minimal style, avoiding unnecessary elements so that the essential information stands out. The project was created in Adobe Photoshop as a promotional piece for social media and print.
							The final design can be seen on Instagram: @cirk.basketball.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic21.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Both posters were created for a university project.
							<br>The first poster (left) is a concept for a sci-fi movie called “Escape”, where we play the main characters. The plot follows a survival test set in the 4th dimension, where participants must solve challenges together — testing their emotions, strength, and intelligence. Only up to two people can pass, but the obstacles require teamwork. In the story, they are being chased by a monster, which adds constant danger and urgency to their mission to escape.
							<br>The second poster (right) is a commercial ad for a new coconut-flavored chocolate banana. The concept shows a purple chocolate banana placed inside a giant coconut, highlighting the exotic mix of flavors in a playful and eye-catching way.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic22.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>These are a couple of design concepts created as mockups for hoodies. The designs aim to showcase unique visuals that blend creativity and style, suitable for casual wear. Each mockup presents how the artwork would look when printed on a hoodie, helping to visualize the final product in a realistic way.</p>

							<p>I created this “Stream starting Soon” screen for my Twitch streams using <b>Adobe After Effects.</b>
							The idea was to make something personal and eye-catching for my stream intro — a short animation that reflects my style and gaming vibe. It’s a fun project I made for myself, but also a way to practice animation and improve my motion design skills.</p>
